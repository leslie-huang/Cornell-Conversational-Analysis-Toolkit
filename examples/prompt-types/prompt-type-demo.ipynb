It is also important for us to reflect on the fact that the disease has been quite widespread among poultry in south - east Asia for two or three years , but has infected relatively few people . We would have much better protection for poultry workers and anyone who was going to go on to a farm in this country to deal with an outbreak .\n",

Our rail franchising reform has the dual purpose of promoting private sector investment and delivering better services to passengers and of reducing the cost of running the railways . As I said in answer to the previous question , that is part of the wider strategy of working with the rail industry to get costs down and provide better value for money for passengers .\n",

We want to provide homes for Londoners .

It is really important that when there are regimes that we do not wish to invite to this country , the relevant international sanctions should be in place to back that up .

    "One thorn in our sides might be that the model occasionally gets caught up on very generic motifs e.g., `'is>*'`, and as such, will fit many questions to the type containing `'is>*'` instead of going with a better signal; various optional parameters detailed in the documentation may provide incomplete solutions to this. Another caveat is that while this model allows us to associate together lexically-diverging phrasings (e.g., \"will the Minister admit\" and \"does the Minister not realise\" both serve to be accusatory towards the Minister), we are ultimately relying on the fact that our domain has a sufficient amount of lexical regularity (e.g., the institutional norms of how people talk in parliament) -- we might need to be cleverer when dealing with noisier settings where this regularity isn't guaranteed (like social media data). \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, as a data-specific note, one of the types may be a result of the parser assuming that \"Will the learned Gentleman please answer my question?\" has \"learned\" as the root verb -- an artefact of parliamentary discourse we haven't handled. You may wish to play around with this by modifying how the data is preprocessed."

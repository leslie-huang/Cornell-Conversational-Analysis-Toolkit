I note that the hon Lady has not withdrawn that observation . The hon Lady should realise that if she wishes , as I wish , to encourage more people to use the railway service , it is manifestly clear that the best way to do that is to ensure that the railways face the same competition as other transport services . Experience with the airlines , buses and other forms of transport has invariably shown that the travelling public get a better quality of service when choice is available . That is why the Dutch and Japanese Governments and the European Commission are pointing in that direction . On past form , we shall have to wait only a few years before the Labour party comes along in the same direction .\n",

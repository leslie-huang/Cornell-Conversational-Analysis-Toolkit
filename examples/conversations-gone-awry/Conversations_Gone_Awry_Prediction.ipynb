    "# Predicting Conversations Gone Awry With Convokit\n",
    "\n",
    "This interactive tutorial demonstrates how to predict whether a conversation will eventually lead to a personal attack, as seen in the paper [Conversations Gone Awry: Detecting Early Signs of Conversational Failure](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Conversations_gone_awry.html), using the tools provided by ConvoKit. It also serves as an illustration of how to use two transformers implemented by ConvoKit: PromptTypes and politeness strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that due to updates in the implementation of ConvoKit modules as well as libraries we've used, the results in the notebook deviate slightly from what was presented in the paper; however, the overall findings match fairly closely."

In the time since initial release, the dataset has been expanded with additional labeled samples, with the later annotation rounds focusing on longer conversations. Since this example notebook is based on the original Awry paper, we will now filter the corpus to keep only the conversations from the original dataset. This can be achieved by checking the \"annotation_year\" metadata entry; original data will have the value \"2018\". However, if you may also skip this filtering stage (skip directly to \"Step 2: Extract prompt types features\") if you wish to run the model on the complete dataset (note that the notebook will take quite a while longer to run)."

    "In this step, we will extract the first of the two types of pragmatic features seen in the paper: prompt types. We can learn prompt types and compute types for each utterance in the corpus using ConvoKit's PromptTypeWrapper class (which implements an end-to-end pipeline that extracts prompt types; see [this notebook](https://github.com/CornellNLP/Cornell-Conversational-Analysis-Toolkit/blob/master/examples/prompt-types/prompt-type-demo.ipynb) for examples of particular steps in that pipeline). Note that in keeping with proper machine learning practices, we need a different dataset to use for training the PromptTypeWrapper object. For this, we will use Convokit's Wikipedia talk corpus (\"wiki-corpus\"), which is composed of Wikipedia talk page conversations different from those found in the Awry corpus."

      "32816 The main reason that PAR\\u2019s revert was reasonable is that your changed wording implies that the tax savings are the important driving cause of wealth condensation, but that\\u2019s clearly wrong. Saving and investment lead to wealth accumulation because the value of investments increases over time as the society prospers and its economy grows. The poorest of the poor pay very little tax, and for good reason \\u2013 they need all the money they can get just to pay for food. The richest of the rich don\\u2019t need to spend much money as a percentage of their wealth, so they invest it instead.

There is a formal, official Code governing the proper spelling of scientific names (the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]). One of the rules is that the name of a species must agree in gender with the name of the genus. The name \\\"Pyrops\\\" is masculine, and all names in the genus must be formed to also be masculine. While it is true that nearly everyone in the world refers to the species as \\\"candelaria\\\", those folks who do so are all wrong, and their ignorance of the rule is no reason to perpetuate the misspelling. That's exactly why rules of nomenclature exist; so when there is a difference of opinion, there is one clear and definitive answer.

Last week we discussed the inclusion of the fact that stock photography was used on the Newt Gingrich fundraising committee website, which you seem to think is important but I think is trivial. I gave a [[Talk:Newt_Gingrich_presidential_campaign,_2012|perfectly reasonable explanation]] for why it should not be included, but you did not respond. Specifically, I challenged your claim that it was \\\"widely covered\\\" and demonstrated it was not. Several days later, without any response, I changed it back. Now, I see that you still have not responded on the talk page, but your edit summary stated that \\\"there is no clear dispute of the material on the talk page\\\". That's not true. I don't dispute that it's factual, but I do dispute that it's relevant. Based on guidelines, I don't think it belongs. And please do not accuse me of edit warring.

      "462114 Fantasy, just to clarify, because we had discussed this some before.  At the time your grandfather died in prison wasn't his political goal more for having the province join again with Austria?  It seems by the mid 60s there was a situation with relatively equal language rights and an influential SVP; please correct me if I'm wrong.  Anyway, I believe no one is saying to remove any names.  The opposite is true, and I would personally insist that the Italian, German, and most importantly local dialects are included.  Also, it is a good learning experience to also realize that others in the region were pushed down in the past.  In order for the German language to come into this region originally, it took some domination over the locals.  So it is a cycle that goes on and on.

However, I wouldn't call for desysopping of an admin based upon one bad act.  Also, as a practical matter, it is clear that a lot of people think he actually behaved appropriately.  That is very disapointing to me, but it is what it is and it shows that we are a long way away from support for desysopping.  Desysopping is a very rare event, by the way.  I don't know the exact number of people that have been desysopped, but it is only a handful - less than 10 I think.

What you wrote about the Morgan family name is absolutely fine, it just belongs in the article on the Morgan family name, with perhaps a link in LHM's article to the article on the name.  Yes, you quoted a source - I didn't say it was unreferenced.  But the source doesn't mention LHM at all, so the inference on our part connecting him to the family is indeed synthesis, ''even if it is true''.

      "275172 Patton's representative contacted the foundation about this matter and I handled the case. You say Patton's representative \\\"could not provide a valid reference for the middle name change\\\" but could you provide a valid reference for the name that you repeatedly restored? I ask because the version of the article I came to had no source at all cited and I looked back through a number of different versions of the article and it doesn't seem to have ever been sourced and actually seems to have first been added by an IP user [http:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/w\\/index.php?title=Will_Patton&action=historysubmit&diff=221627312&oldid=214695609]. Interestingly, the IP who added that information made one other edit that day and that was to add false information to the [[Lewis Black]] article [http:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/w\\/index.php?title=Lewis_Black&diff=prev&oldid=221567288]. While IMDb is generally considered a questionable source under the reliable sources guideline due to the fact the bulk of their material is user-generated, in this case we have on the one hand a completely unsourced BLP containing questionable unsourced information and on the other, a representative of the subject telling us this information is incorrect and that IMDb's information is correct. WP:RS is very important but don't forget it is a guideline and it doesn't trump the policy on biographies of living people which requires questionable unsourced information be \\\"removed immediately and without waiting for discussion\\\" and also clearly states that we should \\\"remove any unsourced material to which an editor objects in good faith\\\". We absolutely should not be maintaining unsourced information in BLPs that we've been told by the subject's representative is false. I can understand you generally not wanting to accept IMDb as a source and I've explained to Patton's people that IMDb is considered a questionable source for most information due to the user generated content, but I cannot understand you insisting on maintaining unsourced information in a BLP when you've been told it is incorrect and repeatedly reverting to keep the unsourced information in the article. I would have understood if you'd just removed the middle name entirely on being told it was incorrect as as it's really not vital to have a person's middle name and no middle name is certainly better than a false one, but I can't understand you insisting that the unsourced name had to remain in the article in the face of a representative of the artist saying it was not only unsourced but incorrect. Even if you don't believe the person was who they claimed, the fact remains the information originally in the article was unsourced and someone was making what appeared to be a good faith attempt to tell us this information is incorrect. Think about this carefully for a moment: The original middle name that you repeated restored to the article was unsourced. While I agree that IMDb is not a great source to use, it's certainly a step up from no source at all. I will also add that I'm not entirely comfortable with the way you were using rollback in this case. Rollback should only be used on vandalism and blatantly unproductive edits. Those edits were made by someone you knew was identifying themselves as a representative of the subject and there was no evidence at all to suggest that they were a vandal or otherwise editing in bad faith, rather they had explained that they were making a good faith attempt to remove incorrect unsourced information from a BLP, which is entirely supported by policy. This was more like a content dispute and it is not what rollback is meant to be used for. I would really urge you to be more careful with your use of rollback in future and perhaps have another look over the rollback guideline. \n",

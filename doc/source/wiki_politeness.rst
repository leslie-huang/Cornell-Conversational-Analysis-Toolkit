Dataset details
---------------
 

Utterance-level information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each utterance corresponds to a Wikipedia Talk Page request. For each utterance, we provide:

* id: ID of the request given in the original data release.
* speaker: the author of the utterance
* conversation_id: id of the first utterance in the conversation this utterance belongs to, which in this case is the id of the utterance itself
* reply_to: None. In this dataset, each request is seen as a full conversation, and thus all utterances are at the 'root' of the conversations
* timestamp: "NOT_RECORDED".
* text: textual content of the utterance.

Metadata for each utterance is inherited from the general CMV corpus:

* Normalized Score: Normalized politeness score computed based on annotations. 
* Binary: A binarized politeness label where 1="polite", 0="neutral", -1 = "impolite".
* Annotations: the original annotations from Amazon Mechanical Turkers for the given utterance. Ratings are on a 1-25 scale. 
* parsed: dependency-parsed version of the utterance text

Dataset details
---------------

Speaker-level information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Speakers in this dataset are Reddit users; their account names are taken as the user names.

Utterance-level information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each utterance corresponds to a Reddit comment. For each utterance, we provide:

* id: Reddit ID of the comment represented by the utterance
* speaker: the speaker who authored the utterance
* conversation_id: id of the first utterance in the conversation this utterance belongs to. Note that this differs from how 'conversation_id' is treated in ConvoKit's general Reddit corpora: in those corpora a conversation is considered to start with a Reddit post utterance, whereas in this corpus a conversation is considered to start with a top-level reply to a post.
* reply_to: Reddit ID of the utterance to which this utterance replies to (None if the utterance represents a top-level comment, i.e., a reply to a post)
* timestamp: time of the utterance
* text: textual content of the utterance

Metadata for each utterance is inherited from the general CMV corpus:

* score: score (i.e., the number of upvotes minus the number of downvotes) of the content 
* top_level_comment: the id of the top level comment (None if the utterance is a post)
* retrieved_on: unix timestamp of the time of when the data is retrieved 
* gilded: gilded status of the content
* gildings: gilding information of the content
* stickied: stickied status of the content
* permalink: permanent link of the content
* author_flair_text: flair of the author 


Conversational-level information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Metadata for each conversation include:

* pair_id: the id of the conversation that this conversation is paired with
* has_removed_comment: whether the final comment in this thread was removed by CMV moderators for violation of Rule 2
* split: which split (train, val, or test) this conversation was used in for the experiments described in "Trouble on the Horizon"

Cornell Conversational Analysis Toolkit (ConvoKit) Documentation
================================================================

This toolkit contains tools to extract conversational features and analyze social phenomena in conversations, using a `single unified interface <https://convokit.cornell.edu/documentation/architecture.html>`_ inspired by (and compatible with) scikit-learn.
Several large `conversational datasets <https://github.com/CornellNLP/Cornell-Conversational-Analysis-Toolkit#datasets>`_ are included together with scripts exemplifying the use of the toolkit on these datasets.
More information can be found at our `website <https://convokit.cornell.edu>`_. The latest version is `2.4.2 <https://github.com/CornellNLP/Cornell-Conversational-Analysis-Toolkit/releases/tag/v2.4>`_ (released 05 Sep 2020).

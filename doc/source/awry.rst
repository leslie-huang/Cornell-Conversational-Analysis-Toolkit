Dataset details
---------------

Speaker-level information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

speakers in this dataset are Wikipedia editors; their account names are taken as the speaker names.

Utterance-level information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each conversational turn on the talk page is viewed as an utterance. For each utterance, we provide:

* id: index of the utterance
* speaker: the speaker who author the utterance
* conversation_id: id of the first utterance in the conversation this utterance belongs to
* reply_to: index of the utterance to which this utterance replies to (None if the utterance is not a reply)
* timestamp: time of the utterance
* text: textual content of the utterance

Metadata for each utterance include:

* is_section_header: whether the utterance is a conversation "title" or "subject" as seen on the original talk page (if true, this utterance should be ignored when doing any NLP tasks)
* comment_has_personal_attack: whether this comment was judged by 3 crowdsourced annotators to contain a personal attack
* parsed: parsed version of the utterance text, represented as a SpaCy Doc


Conversational-level information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Metadata for each conversation include:

* page_title: the title of the talk page the comment came from
* page_id: the unique numerical ID of the talk page the comment came from
* pair_id: the id of the conversation that this comment's conversation is paired with
* conversation_has_personal_attack: whether any comment in this comment's conversation contains a personal attack according to crowdsourced annotators
* verified: whether the personal attack label has been double-checked by an internal annotator and confirmed to be correct 
* pair_verified: whether the personal attack label for the paired conversation has been double-checked by an internal annotator and confirmed to be correct 
* annotation_year: which round of annotation the conversation's label came from. Possible values are "2018" for the first annotation round and "2019" for the second annotation round.
* split: which split (train, val, or test) this conversation was used in for the experiments described in "Trouble on the Horizon" (not applicable to results from "Conversations Gone Awry", which reports leave-one-out accuracies).
